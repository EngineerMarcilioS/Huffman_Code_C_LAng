#This material is dedicated to people with a basic level of programming, and who want to develop skills in programming logic, C language and data structure.In this work I decided to gather all the lessons learned in an online C course, which were put together in a logical and structured way. The result is this wonderful algorithm, which historically was the result of PHD work of Mr. Huffman.

# Huffman_Code_C_LAng

##This is a complete code huffman write on c language. A simple project to trainning concepts on Data structures and other.

There are some techniques on data compression around the world and the Huffman strategy is one of the most beatiful
taking concepts like data structures using  linked list, tree, frequency table, dictionary and operations like bitwise
you will take as a result a reduction a binary file with size less than original in txt. With big txt files you will have more compression because there are more character repetition.
 

Steps to use:
1- You can change the main.c file in any text editor and save.
2-You need to compile it, in this case run command gcc main.c
3-Change the text inside the file.txt
4-run command in cli: ./a.out "This is a binary generated after step 2.
5-A new file made in binary will be generated "compressed_file.bin" that contain data from file.txt, but less bits is 
needed.
