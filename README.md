# Huffman_Code_C_LAng

##This is a complete code huffman write on c language. A simple project to trainning concepts on Data structures and other.

There are some techniques on data compression around the world and the Huffman strategy is one of the most beatiful
taking concepts like data structures using  linked list, tree, frequency table, dictionary and operations like bitwise
you will take as a result a reduction a binary file with size less than original in txt. With big txt files you will have
more compression because there are more character repetition.
